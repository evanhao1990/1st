# README #

### What is this repository for? ###

* Storing useful code snippets, plots and queries.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* File names should be clear, try use key words -> i.e groupby_rolling_mean.py, regression_plot.md, availability_rate.sql
* Python 'one-liners' can be stored as .py files. 
* More complicated items that would benefit from an example (i.e a groupby with printed result output) should be saved as .md files.
* Plots should always be saved as .md files, and be reproducible.
