May help to understand a few issues with BQ data: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43880721/google-analytics-metrics-are-inflated-when-extracting-hit-level-data-using-bigqu


-- Notes:
# Im not including totals.hits and totals.pageviews as they dont mean anything in our current set up (eg pages can be tagged as event so they are not in pageviews, events may create multiple events - eg site speed event)
# userID --> we disabled it, so it is still not being tracked - should be very powerful as google can track users even if using different devices
# do we want visitNumber? we shall further investigate the accuracy of that metric
