-- The UX team designs according to 4 browser sizes and thus the device size or category only partially overlaps with this definition
-- E.G. the wide menu is only seen by breakpoint 4 which should mostly regard Desktop users, but could also include tablet sessions
-- the breakpoints regard the BROWSER WIDTH as follows:
	-- Breakpoint 1: 0-659 megapixels, also called Mobile
	-- Breakpoint 2: 660-869, also called Small Tablet (this is the least relevant breakpoint)
	-- Breakpoint 3: 870-1279, Large Tablet
	-- Breakpoint 4: 1280+, Desktop
